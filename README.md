# Personal Discord Bot
Just a dump of my discord bot if anyone is interested. Requires discord.js 8.1.0 or lower, and a whole bunch of other stuff. Can play audio from youtube, run a radio station from Deezer (a service similar to Spotify), create graphs from your Overwatch stats, search poe.trade from the Path of Exile marketplace, and some other stuff.
